# Description of tasks for laboratory:

The first laboratory.

On a field of size 500x600 apply a grid of size 20x20.

The second laboratory.

Write a program that builds in the middle of the screen the coordinate 
system XY and on it the graph of the function Y = F (X), if the argument or parameter changes on the interval [a; b] with step h.

The third laboratory.

Construct in the center of the screen an image consisting of 2 circles. A circle of larger radius (R = 20 pseudopixels measuring 20x20 pixels) of red color should be realized based on the equation x2 + y2 = R2. A circle of smaller radius (R = 18 pseudopixels measuring 20x20 pixels) of blue color should be realized based on the equation x = R cosα, y = R sin α.

The fourth laboratory.

Display the rotation of the ellipse in an invisible circular contour clockwise with a change in its size.
