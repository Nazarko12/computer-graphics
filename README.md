* The third laboratory.

Construct in the center of the screen an image consisting of 2 circles. A circle of larger radius (R = 20 pseudopixels measuring 20x20 pixels) of red color should be realized based on the equation x2 + y2 = R2. A circle of smaller radius (R = 18 pseudopixels measuring 20x20 pixels) of blue color should be realized based on the equation x = R cosα, y = R sin α.
